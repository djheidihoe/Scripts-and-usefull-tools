# Scripts-and-usefull-tools
in this repo i want to share scripts and other useful tools / tooltips.

I am lazy and don't like to click the mouse.

So on Chromium i use [vimium] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb ) to have a full keyboard browser experience.
To install new programs every mac user should use [**brew**](https://brew.sh/) - yes it is great.
If you open the terminal and are stuck, just use the [tldr tool](https://tldr.sh/) if you don't want to read the full man page. So when you have already installed brew just go: brew install tldr

The update script will run full update and upgrade on your brewed apps, reload the tldr and show you what python plugins you should update as well.

Some other Scripts might follow.

Hey by the way, the "musthave-mac-script.sh" is my first script i have build from scratch. I am open how to further improve it.
You could add it to a cron job, but i have some odd stuff happening if i update my browser and still have the app running, so i trigger the script manually therefore.
